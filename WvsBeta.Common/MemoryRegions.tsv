# This is the configuration file for memory regions
# These are used by the client for CRC32. There's
# a small randomness included to prevent simple
# anti-anti-hack systems.
#
# There can be up to 0x7FFF blocks, but be cautious:
# CRC32 does have an overhead.
#
# Empty lines and lines with # are skipped
# These lines are regions of the binary. fileOffset is 
# shown in IDA, left-bottom of IDA-View screen
